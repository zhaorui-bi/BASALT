# Prerequisites

## 📊 Type of input data for BASALT
BASALT is a versatile tool with high efficiency for binning and post-binning refinement. BASALT can generate high quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from various input data types including: 1) assembly from short-read sequences (SRS); 2) assembly from long-read sequences (LRS); [Note: only PacBio-HiFi data is supported in the current version for long-read only assemblies, other types of LRS data will be available in later versions.] 3) hybrid assembly from SRS + LRS. Specific features of BASALT are listed below:

1.	Multiple assemblies as input with dereplication function
BASALT developed a comprehensive method incorporating multiple assembly files, including single assemblies (SAs) and co-assemblies (CAs) in one run. Additionally, a dereplication step is applied after initial binning to efficiently remove redundant bins. Comparatively, prominent binning tools such as metaWRAP [1] and DASTool [2] only support single assembly file as input, where multiple binning processes are required if there are multiple assembly files in a dataset. Moreover, redundant bins generated under SA + CA mode need to be removed using dereplication tools such as dRep [3]. Although BASALT takes longer time than metaWRAP and DASTool in one single run, considerable amount of time will be saved when processing multiple assembly files, and a significantly more and better quality MAGs can be generated by BASALT than other tools, based on our assessment [4].

2.	Standalone Refinement module
BASALT can effectively identify and remove potential contamination sequences in Refinement module based on neural networks. Specifically, users can import their bins along with raw sequences to BASALT to run the Refinement module independently without initial binning using BASALT.

3.	High read use efficiency of LRS
BASALT maximized the utilization of LRS in the post-binning refinement steps. Firstly, LRS will be used at Sequence retrieval step by recruiting unused sequences to target bins via pair-end tracking. After processing the Sequence retrieval function, an extra polishing step will be performed in the existence of LRS. Polishing at this step will save ~90% of the computation time than conducting at assembly step with same iterations, as the data size is largely reduced. Furthermore, LRS will be exploited again at reassembly step using the SPAdes Hybrid function (default). [Note: reassembly function is not applicable on LRS-alone dataset in the current version of BASALT, but will be available in later version.] Although reassembly may take a considerable amount of time, large augmentation of genome quality can be observed after reassembly.

## 💻 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
1.	Required dependencies

  	Linux x64 systems, 8+ cores, and 128GB+ RAM

  	Python (>=3.0) modules: biopython, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, copy, multiprocessing, collections，pytorch, tensorboardx

  	Perl

  	Java (>=1.7)

  	Binning tools: MetaBAT2, Maxbin2, CONCOCT, Semibin2, LorBin

  	Note: VAMB was used to be implemented in BASALT, but due to the conflict of environment and unsatisfactory performance on environmental datasets, we temporarily removed VAMB from BASALT environment. However, bins generated using VAMB can still be imported to BASALT directly for post-binning refinements.

  	Sequences processing tools: Bowtie2, BWA, SAMtools, Prodigal, BLAST+, HMMER, Minimap2

  	Sequences assembly and polishing tools: SPAdes, IDBA-UD, Pilon, Racon, Unicycler

  	Genome quality assessment tools: CheckM, CheckM2, pplacer

  	Note: CheckM2 database is not compiled along with BASALT installation in v1.0.1. To setup CheckM2 database, please refer to CheckM2 user guide (https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2).
